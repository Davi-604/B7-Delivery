-   Project based on [B7web](https://lp.b7web.com.br/fullstack) course. This project is only the front-end part from the finall project, but it has a some features that I made, how verifications with zod and a few things that then teacher did'nt do. In the futere it'll receive atualizations and it'll be a fullstack project 🚀
    <br/><br/>

-   It's a mult-tenancy project, how example there're two tenants for test, but it doesn't have a DB yet, so the data is all statics.
